Out with the old, in with the new. I’ve decided to start fresh again here on my website, at least on my [https://duncan.dev](https://duncan.dev) domain. Why? Lots of reasons, I suppose, not the least of which is that I wanted to take a step back and re-think how everything goes together in my online presence. I’m tidying up some other loose ends right now, so I figured, “why not?”

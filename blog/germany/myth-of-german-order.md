One of the most suprising things I found after moving to Germany was that it’s not nearly as orderly as its international reputation suggests. [Maurice Frank digs into the myth of German order at Berliner Zeitung][link]:

> In reality, the country is marked by far more lawlessness, sloppiness, inefficiency and incompetence than its self-image suggests. Daily life is bureaucratic, pointlessly complex or involves outdated systems and technologies. Interactions with institutions great and small are often difficult.

Don’t get me wrong. There’s a lot in Germany that works well, and I’m thankful for several aspects of life here — including having people at the top of government that are willing to listen to science. But I’ve slowly lost my surprise when something doesn’t go as smoothly as I think it should. Instead, I’m now more suprised when something goes more smoothly than I expect.

The shear toxic brutality of the way Trump used Twitter is on display in the [New York Timeâ€™s compilation of Trumpâ€™s insults on Twitter][link] from when he declared his candidacy until he was banned. Kevin Quealy writes:

> As a political figure, Donald J. Trump used Twitter to praise, to cajole, to entertain, to lobby, to establish his version of events â€” and, perhaps most notably, to amplify his scorn.

I did a quick histogram of the words in the list. You probably wonâ€™t be suprised that most used words are "fake" and "news".

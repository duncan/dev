title: The complete list of Trump’s insults on Twitter
---

The shear toxic brutality of the way Trump used Twitter is on display in the [New York Time’s compilation of Trump’s insults on Twitter][link] from when he declared his candidacy until he was banned. Kevin Quealy writes:

> As a political figure, Donald J. Trump used Twitter to praise, to cajole, to entertain, to lobby, to establish his version of events — and, perhaps most notably, to amplify his scorn.

I did a quick histogram of the words in the list. You probably won’t be suprised that most used words are "fake" and "news".

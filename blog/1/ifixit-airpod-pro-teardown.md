iFixitâ€™s teardowns have always been good, but they keep evolving and have become pretty great. Their latest [tear down of Appleâ€™s AirPods Max][link] is simply delicious, and I really love the video x-ray orbits.

> And after tearing down some of the competition, weâ€™re more understanding of that $550 price tag. Sony and Bose both charge less, but internally, the AirPods Maxâ€™s obsessive craftsmanship makes those other extremely capable devices look like toys by comparison.

The teardown really features the beautiful work by Appleâ€™s team. I still havenâ€™t picked up a pair, but despite the price tag, they are on my list for the next time I need to reward myself for something.

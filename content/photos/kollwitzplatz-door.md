Life in Berlin continues apace during the pandemic. I find myself walking the same routes around my neighborhood, going by buildings both modern and classical. Some pristine, others covered with layers of graffiti. I long for trips to other parts of the world but am thankful that I’m somewhere that I’m still a relative newbie too and can appreciate for its otherness.

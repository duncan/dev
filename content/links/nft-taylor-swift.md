Ben Thompson writes about [Taylor Swift deciding where the value in her work lays][link]:

> What is notable about Swift’s tactics is that they are the opposite of what she urged in that 2014 op-ed. Instead of treasuring “Fearless”, Swift devalued it; instead of asking for what her masters are worth, Swift is simply taking them. Patel was right that while art may be important, on the Internet it’s not rare; what he missed is how that makes Swift more powerful than ever.

It’s a brilliant tactic that illustrates how we assign value in our world, and how that assignment gets exercised. And all you have to do to illustrate the point to yourself is open up your music streaming app of choice, and choose which version of Taylor Swift you want to hear.

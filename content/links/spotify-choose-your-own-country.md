title: Spotify goes Work From Anywhere (WFA)
description: Spotify joins the remote work from anywhere movement that’s sweeping through the tech industry. There’s not a better time for it.

The distributed remote work movement keeps getting traction, this time with [Spotify joining the chorus allowing their employees to choose their geographic location][link]:

> Needless to say, the events of the last year accelerated this thinking—and there’s no better time than now to transition into a distributed-first model—a workplace that isn’t built on the premise that employees need to gather in an office with traditional desk setups.

I’m interested to see what limitations they’ll have to put on time-zones and countries available. I’m also curious to see how their plans shape up against the ones that [Shopify][s], [Twitter][t], and others are implementing.

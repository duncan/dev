Scientists at the Human Adaption Institute wanted to understand better how people adapt to drastic changes in living environments, so they got some volunteers to spend [40 days in a cave without a clock][link].

> “It was like pressing pause,” said Marina Lançon, one of seven women to take part in the experiment. She did not feel any rush to do anything and wished she could have stayed in the cave a few days longer, she said, but that she was happy to feel the wind and hear birdsong again.

Following their own biological clocks, the participants could sleep and eat at their own pace and lose their sense of time. For some, it felt like they were there 30 days or even just 23 days. Wild.

Om Malikâ€™s latest is on why the [iPhone is todayâ€™s Brownie camera][link]:

> Photography as we know it has been around for about 150 years, though its origins can be traced to earlier civilizations. But it has never been so visceral, and so much a part of our daily lives, as it is now. In short, the arc of photographyâ€™s history is that it has always been about getting more and more people to take photographs.

Photography can be mundane or sublime. It can be transcendent art, or it can be simple documentation. However, its real power comes from the fact that anybody can do it. The tools to do it are becoming more available and more capable with each passing year.

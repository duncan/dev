In a presentation for [Protocol][p], Benedict Evans takes an [in-depth look the fundamental tech trends][link] that will be driving it as it enters its second 50 years.

> Covid brought shock and a lot of broken habits to tech, but mostly, it accelerates everything that was already changing. 20 trillion dollars of retail, brands, TV and advertising is being overturned, and software is remaking everything from cars to pharma. Meanwhile, China has more smartphone users than Europe and the USA combined, and India is close behind - technology and innovation will be much more widely spread.

We spent the last 50 years getting tech into everyoneâ€™s hands. The next 50 years are all about figuring out what happens now that everyoneâ€™s got it. I think I need to go back through this presentation a couple of times, as well as [his slides][s], and make a lot of notes.

By the way, both my current employer and my next employer get mentions in this presentation. Thatâ€™s kinda cool. ðŸ˜€

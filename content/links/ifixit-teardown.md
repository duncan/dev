iFixitâ€™s teardowns have always been good, but they keep evolving. Their latest [tear down of Appleâ€™s AirPods Max][link] is simply delicious, and I really, _really_ love the video x-ray orbits.

> And after tearing down some of the competition, weâ€™re more understanding of that $550 price tag. Sony and Bose both charge less, but internally, the AirPods Maxâ€™s obsessive craftsmanship makes those other extremely capable devices look like toys by comparison.

The teardown really features the beautiful work by Appleâ€™s team. I still havenâ€™t picked up a pair but I continue to hear good things about them and they are on my list of things to consider the next time I need to reward myself for something.

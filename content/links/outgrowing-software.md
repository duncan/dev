Benedict Evans writes about what comes [after technological change sweeps through an industry:][link]

> Thereâ€™s an old joke that consultants are like seagulls - they fly in, make lots of noise, mess everything up and then fly out. Thatâ€™s pretty much what tech has done to media industries - it changes everything and then it leaves. Now thatâ€™s happening to retail - everything that tech, software and the internet did to media is now happening to retailers.

At a certain point, weâ€™re all natives of this technological world. Then weâ€™ll be left with many of the same questions that we started within a much different-looking world. Thatâ€™s when real magic will happen, I think.

Dave Troy has been digging into [the connections leading up to the January 6th insurrection at the US Capitol][link]. He has just published a considerable thread detailing those connections going back decades. He starts out with:

> In 1975-1976, the Church Committee investigated allegations that CIA, NSA, FBI, IRS, and Army intelligence had spied on Americans and otherwise abused power; the committeeâ€™s work led to changes that greatly limited the power of these agencies.

Itâ€™s a lot to take in all at once. However, I know that Dave and others have done their homework on this. [The full dump][g], including references, is also available in a single document.

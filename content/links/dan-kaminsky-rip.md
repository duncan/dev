We all owe a debt of gratitude to Dan Kaminsky and Iâ€™m sad that heâ€™s no longer with us. Heâ€™s widely known for [saving the internet][link]:

> What Mr. Kaminsky discovered in 2008 was a problem with the internetâ€™s basic address system, known as the Domain Name System, or DNS, a dynamic phone book that converts human-friendly web addresses like NYTimes.com and Google.com into their machine-friendly numeric counterparts. He found a way that thieves or spies could covertly manipulate DNS traffic so that a person typing the website for a bank would instead be redirected to an impostor site that could steal the userâ€™s account number and password.

More than that, however, he was a really nice person. The kind of person that you really want to have in the world. Rest in peace, Dan.

title: The case of aaaabbbcca
description: Implicit in a recent pointer to a code puzzle was the fact that a test-driven approach would be perfect.
---

[Allen Holub retweeted][aht] a [code puzzle that Alexey Grigorev posted][agt] which Alexey claimed that most candidates couldnâ€™t solve the following within a 25-minute screening interview:

```
Input: "aaaabbbcca"
Output: [("a", 4), ("b", 3), ("c", 2), ("a", 1)]
```

My first thought was that this should be easy: a quick matter of counting up the number of times each letter occurred in the string. Then, I saw that final `a` character and realized that something a little more sophisticated was needed. It took me about 10 minutes (yes, I timed myself) to hack out the following solution in Ruby using IRB:

```ruby
'aaaabbbcca'.chars.reduce([]) do |accum, char|
  if last = accum.last and last[0] == char
    last[1] = last[1] + 1
  else
    accum << [char, 1]
  end
  accum
end
```

This produced the following output, which is close enough even though itâ€™s in Rubyâ€™s array of array output format:

```
[['a', 4], ['b', 3], ['c', 2], ['a', 1]]
```

[Based on my recent interview experience][ego], Iâ€™m really not sure I could have been able to do it within Alexeyâ€™s 25 minute screening. Indeed, Iâ€™d have to be in a reasonable frame of mind to have a shot and not totally flub it up due to performance paralysis.

## Other solutions

A few other solutions stood out in the threads of these discussions. One I quite like is [Sam Rubyâ€™s one liner][sr] using `scan` and a regexp:

```ruby
'aaaabbbcca'.scan(/((.)\2*)/).map(&:first)
```

which returns:

```
["aaaa", "bbb", "cc", "a"]
```

To return the same format mine, you can use the following as the `map` function:

```ruby
.map { |item| [item[1], item[0].size] }
```

VÃ­tÄ›zslav Ackermann Ferko [used the same approach in JavaScript][vat]:

```js
'aaaabbbcca'.match(/((.)\2*)/g).map((v) => [v[0], v.length])
```

I think my absolute favorite, however, is [this solution by Raymond Hettinger][rht]:

```sh
$ echo 'aaaabbbcca' | fold -w 1 | uniq -c
 4 a
 3 b
 2 c
 1 a
```

This one wins the prize! ðŸ’¥

## Letâ€™s be test-driven, ok?

Implicit (to me at least) in Allenâ€™s pointer to the problem is that this is the kind of thing that would be great for a test-driven approach. So, instead of hacking it out in IRB, I could have written a test first:

```ruby
def test_simple
  expected = [['a', 4], ['b', 3], ['c', 2], ['a', 1]]
  assert_equal expected, solve('aaaabbbcca')
end
```

You might think that setting up a test-driven approach is overkill for a code puzzle like this. Certainly, it can be a pain in the arse to set up seperate files and a test driver. In Ruby, at least, you can do this in a single file:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

def solve(input)
  input.chars.reduce([]) do |accum, char|
    if last = accum.last and last[0] == char
      last[1] = last[1] + 1
    else
      accum << [char, 1]
    end
    accum
  end
end

require 'test/unit'

class Tests < Test::Unit::TestCase
  def test_simple
    expected = [['a', 4], ['b', 3], ['c', 2], ['a', 1]]
    assert_equal expected, solve('aaaabbbcca')
  end
end
```

I started using this approach in the last code interview I did recently, and it out really worked nicely. It certainly helped keep my thinking a little bit more structured during the process.

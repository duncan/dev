title: Microsoftâ€™s climate moon shot, one year later
description: Brad Smithâ€™s report on Microsoftâ€™s committment to being carbon negative by 2030.
---

Itâ€™s hard to believe that itâ€™s been a year since Microsoft announced their commitment to being carbon negative by 2030. Since then, the company has reduced its emissions by 6% and purchased the removal of 1.3 million metric tons of carbon. While this is a tremendous early win, the big problems remain, as [Brad Smith discusses in a progress report on Microsoftâ€˜s climate efforts][link].

> Today there is no real existing carbon removal ecosystem and the world must build a new market on an unprecedented scale and timeline, from nearly scratch. This will be incredibly hard, requiring integrity, public-private coordination, and heavy investment simultaneously.

Bradâ€™s analogy is that if this is a moonshot, the efforts so far amount to having put an astronaut into orbit. Itâ€™s a significant step and an impressive first year, but thereâ€™s so much more to do.

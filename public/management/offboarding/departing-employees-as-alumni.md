description: Perfectly timed for my own offboarding, HBR discusses how having a good offboarding process is important.

Since I’m right in the middle of an offboarding process, the timing of the current [Harvard Business Review’s article on offboarding][link] couldn’t be more appropriate.

> “Companies strive to create an outstanding experience when someone enters the organization,” says Mike Quinn, senior vice president for integration at the chemicals company Synthomer. “Similarly, when somebody is exiting the organization, even under trying circumstances, you want to be sure that the process and experience reflect the overall culture of the organization.”

I’m amazed at how my own offboarding experience from Microsoft mirrors my experience at the company almost every way, from the good parts to the mediocre to the tone-deaf.

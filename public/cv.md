_This is the long version. See [Duncan’s resume](/resume) if you want the short version._

**James Duncan Davidson is a seasoned technology leader with a non-traditional career path guided by deep interests in technology, architecture, and art.** He is a generalist at heart who picks up new technologies, languages, and tools for whatever problem is at hand, always with a [beginner’s mindset][bm]. He has developed and delivered software platforms that millions of developers have used, written books that helped a generation of Mac developers, and made iconic photographs that have promoted hundreds of TED speakers’ presentations.

His career started in the mid-1990s when a chance to work on the early World Wide Web interrupted his university’s architectural studies. He found himself at the right time at the right place. This work led to employment at JavaSoft, a division of Sun Microsystems, where he created [Apache Ant][ant] and [Apache Tomcat][tomcat]. He then led their development and release to the Apache Software Foundation.

After leaving JavaSoft, he dove deep into the Apple ecosystem. He helped a generation of developers learn about Objective-C and Mac OS X through books published by [O’Reilly Media][ora], conference speaking, and consulting.

He also parlayed a lifelong passion as a photographer into a second career documenting events for [TED Conferences][ted], [O’Reilly Media][ora], [Apple’s WWDC][aapl], and [Salesforce][sfe]. His work has appeared in the [New York Times][nyt], [BBC][bbc], and other major international news outlets. He also helped found [Luma Labs][luma], a small business based in Portland, Oregon, that sells camera straps and accessories to photographers worldwide.

During the 2010s, Duncan moved to Berlin and helped Wunderlist launch a significant rewrite of their application backend. He then assisted the company’s acquisition and integration by [Microsoft][ms]. After the acquisition and integration were complete, he has spent two and a half years helping out startups worldwide as a CTO in Residence for [Microsoft for Startups][mfs].

In March 2021, Duncan joined the Office of the CEO at [Shopify][shop], working with Tobi Lütke to help guide the technical direction of the company.

Looking forward, Duncan plans to remain active in technology and software development for at least another decade or two. He will continue making photographs as an amateur for the rest of his life.

## Published Works

### Agile Web Development with Rails

This definitive book about Ruby on Rails by [Dave Thomas][dave] and [David Heinemeier Hansson][dhh] was first published by [Pragmatic Bookshelf][prag] in 2005. After that, Rails moved so fast that a slew of editions followed, and Dave Thomas enlisted a group of co-authors, including Duncan, to contribute.

**2nd Edition: December 2006** was the first edition that Duncan’s material focusing on deploying Rails applications appeared, along with contributions from Leon Breedt, Mike Clark, [Justin Gehtland][geht], and Andreas Schwarz. (ISBN: 978-0977616633)

**3rd Edition: April 2009** was updated for Rails version 2 with [Sam Ruby][samr] taking over as the lead author of the book. (ISBN: 978-1934356166)

**4th Edition: March 2011** was updated for Rails version 3. (ISBN: 978-1934356548)

After the 4th edition, state-of-the-art Rails deployment had evolved enough that an entire rewrite of Duncan’s contributed material was necessary, and he dropped off the author roster for future revisions.

### Mac OS X Panther Hacks

Co-authored with [Rael Dornfest][rael] and published by [O’Reilly Media][ora] in 2004, this book brought together a collection of 100 tips and tricks to help Mac OS X users get the most from their operating system. (ISBN: 978-0596007188)

### Cocoa in a Nutshell

Co-authored with [Micheal Beam][mb] and published by [O’Reilly Media][ora], this book was a definitive reference for the Cocoa APIs that shipped with Mac OS X Panther. (ISBN: 978-0596004620)

### Running Mac OS X

Published by [O’Reilly Media][ora], this book series helped give power users the knowledge they needed to work better and faster with their operating system.

**Running Mac OS X Panther, published 2003** focused on Mac OS X Panther, the second major update to Mac OS X — arguably the release where Mac OS X finished the transition from Mac OS 9. (ISBN: 978-0596005009)

**Running Mac OS X Tiger, published 2005** added [Jason Deraleau][deraleau] to the author roster for the book and updated the material for a new release of Mac OS X. (ISBN: 978-0596009137)

### Learning Cocoa with Objective-C

Published in September 2002 by [O’Reilly Media][ora] and edited by [Chuck Toporek][ct], this was Ducan’s rewrite of Apple’s examples and documentation into a cohesive book that became a staple for developers learning Objective-C on Apple’s platforms for years. (ISBN: 978-0596003012)

After a decade of Mac OS X updates and the introduction of iOS along with the app stores, the book needed a significant rewrite. The 3rd edition, headed up by [Paris Buttfield-Addison][parisba] and [Jonathon Manning][jm], was published in 2012. A 4th edition followed in 2014 with [Tim Nugent][tn] joining the author roster.

### Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition

The Java Servlet API was part of the broader Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) platform. In May 2000, Pearson Education published a collection of all the relevant platform and component specifications for J2EE version 1.0. This included the work of all the J2EE specification leads — [Bill Shannon][bills], [Mark Hapner][markh], [Vlada Matena][vlada], [Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart][epl], [Larry Cable][cable], and Duncan — to create the authoritative book for platform implementors.

### Java API for XML Processing

David Brownell started the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) working group as [Java Specification Request 5][jsr5]. Duncan took over as the group’s chair in 1999 and shipped [JAXP version 1.0][jaxpdf] in March 2000. [Rajiv Mordani][rajiv] took over work on the specification after Version 1.0.

### Java Servlet API

The first versions of the Java Servlet API were created by [Pavni Diwanji][pavni] and [Satish Dharmaraj][satish] and shipped as JavaDoc documentation with the Java Web Server. From that starting point in 1998, Duncan formed a working group of industry representatives and formalized it into a full specification.

**Version 2.0**, released April 1998, including support for internationalization, cookies, session tracking, and support for HTTP/1.1.

**Version 2.1**, released November 1998, included support for request dispatching, information sharing through request contexts, and server-side resource management.

**Version 2.2**, released August 1999, included pluggable web applications, enhanced control over HTTP headers, added response buffering, more control over HTTP response headers, and new request handling methods.

[Rajiv Mordani][rajiv] took over work on the specification after Version 2.2.

## Education

Duncan studied architecture at [Oklahoma State University][okstate], the [University of Houston][uh], and [the University of Texas at Arlington][uta]. However, he did not complete his studies thanks to an opportunity to work on the early web. He thought the detour might be temporary and that he’d return to finish his degree work when interest in the World Wide Web waned.

The web, of course, is still very much a thing.

Before university, Duncan attended [Union High School][uhs] in Tulsa, Oklahoma, [Anderson High School][ahs] in Austin, Texas, and [Newman Smith High School][ns] in Carrollton, Texas.

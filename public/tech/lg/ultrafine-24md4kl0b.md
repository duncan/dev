The biggest drawback of the Apple Silicon M1-based MacBook Pro in day-to-day use at home is the screen. It will be perfect for cafÃ© computing, when we can do that again and be lovely for airplanes when we can travel, too. However, itâ€™s no match for the bigger 27" display on my almost six-year-old iMac 5K thatâ€˜s been the center of my desk.

Until now, I havenâ€™t minded that because the iMac was the fastest machine in my current collection. Thatâ€™s not the case anymore. Since I canâ€™t use the 5K iMacâ€™s display as an external screen, that left me wondering what to do.

One day, I might go nuts and get the Pro Display XDR, but itâ€™s actually too big a display for my current work area. And letâ€™s not mention the price tag. So, for now, I really just want a 24" display. If Apple had a baby 4K version of their Pro Display, Iâ€™d be all over it.

So, I did the next best thing. I picked up the [LG 24" UltraFine 4K display with macOS compatibilty][lg]. By Mac-compatible, they really mean that it has two Thunderbolt 3 and three USB-C ports and can charge up your Mac when you plug it in. And, itâ€™s capable of P3 color.

In just a few minutes of use, Iâ€™m pretty satisfied with it. More than I expected, actually. The screen is big enough for serious multitasking, yet small enough that it lets my desk breathe a bit. The color is gorgeous for photo and video editing. And the simple one-plug display and charge capability is great to have a non-Apple device.

28 compute cores across 7 seperate machines, hosted on a single board that you can put into just about any kind of enclosure that you want and power with a maximum of 40W? Thatâ€™s the [Turing Pi][link] and it looks amazing.

If I had a team of engineers that were developing a system running in Kubernetes, I could see getting them all one of these to be a local test environment. Even without that use case, you know I want one just to serve as my home compute cloud.

title: Apple revamps its syringe emoji
description: Iâ€™m really happy that Appleâ€™s syringe emoji is losing the dripping blood in iOS 14.5. Hopefully other emoji sets follow suite as soon as possible.

[iOS 14.5 will come with a new syringe emoji][link] that features an empty syringe instead of one dripping blood.

> Emojipedia said that while the syringe was once associated with blood donation, it saw a noticeable shift to it being used for vaccinations, alongside other emoji such as a face mask or a microbe.

Oh, thank goodness. Iâ€™m not squeamish, but I prefer an emoji representing the syringe in a generic way, not necessarily just for drawing blood. Hopefully, it wonâ€™t take long for other emoji sets to follow.

title: The cost of startup cloud credits
description: Credits are tempting and who doesnâ€™t like free? They do, however, come with a cost that might hurt later.

During my two and a half years working at Microsoft for Startups, one topic came up more than any other during the first conversation with a startup: credits. Itâ€™s no wonder. Many cloud providers are generous with their offers of credits. If you know the right people to talk to, getting five or even six figures worth of credit isnâ€™t too much of a problem.

Every penny counts for a company just getting started and operating on foundersâ€™ sweat and angel investments. Besides, who doesnâ€™t like free things?

Credits, however, do come with a hidden cost. While clouds have revolutionized access to compute infrastructure, they arenâ€™t quite the same kind of commodities that electricity, sugar, or flour are. There are still switching costs if a company wants to move services from one cloud to another. The highest of those switching costs isnâ€™t monetary. Instead, itâ€™s the time and attention that could otherwise be spent on the most critical problem a startup has. Creating a product and getting it first to product-market fit, then scaling it to meet demand if it manages to find that fit.

To be sure, a startup is never locked into a cloud decision. It can always build new functionality on other clouds or pick a specific tech to use from another cloud in a multi-cloud strategy. You donâ€™t, however, want to spend a teamâ€™s ability to be flexible on moving infrastructure around like chairs on a boat deck if you donâ€™t have to.

I believe that the startups with the best chance of going the distance are those who **pick a cloud and a technology stack at founding and then relentlessly focus on their chosen problem.** Ignore the what-ifs and what-could-have-been and make sure that youâ€™re going to make it as a company. Spend all of your flexibility on your product and adapting it to your customers.

So then, when youâ€™re picking a cloud at founding, what should you make the decision on? Pick the cloud you want to be on for technology, customer access, and developer happiness reasons. If youâ€™re a B2B startup, that point about customer access when youâ€™ve achieved product-market fit can be critically important. Then, after youâ€™ve factored for those points, if you can get a bucket of credits to go with your decision, all the better.

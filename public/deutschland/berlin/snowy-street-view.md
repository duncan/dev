Berlin got really cold this week and we got covered in a nice layer of snow, more than the city has seen in several years now. Because we’re all home for the lockdown, however, it hasn’t made as much of an impact as it would otherwise. Instead, it’s just been a pretty change of view and a chance for the kids to get out and play.

We spent the afternoon near Potsdam on the banks of the Jungfernsee, which translates to “Virgin Lake.” After a prolonged period of cold and snow, it was great to get out of the house and be outside for a few hours with only a light jacket on.

The location here is across the water from [Glienicke Bridge][gb], also known as the Bridge of Spies. This is where the Americans and Soviets would exchange captured prisoners during the Cold War, starting with Gary Powers’ exchange for Rudolf Abel.

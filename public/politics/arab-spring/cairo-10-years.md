It’s the tenth anniversary of the uprising in Cairo, part of the Arab Spring. [Zeynep Tufekci wrote about it in her Substack newsletter][link]:

> It was a time of immense hope. Millions of people poured out into the streets—brimming with expectation and ambition for the future of their own making. Country after country filled to the brim with hope that the region had lacked for so long.

It’s amazing to hear a first person account about the feelings of optimism and hope that poured through the city during that time. Sadly, it didn’t last for long. Division, polarization, and tribalism has prevailed since then.

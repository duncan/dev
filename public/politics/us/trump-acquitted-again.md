So, [Trumpâ€™s second impeachment ends with acquittal][nyt]. We knew that was going to happen, but Iâ€™m still sad that 43 US Senators were unwilling to hold Trump accountable in this way.

It pains me to say that I have some sympathy for Senator McConnellâ€™s arguments for not voting for conviction. However, I canâ€™t see that it would have been a dangerous precedent to vote for conviction even if the penalty of removal from office wasnâ€™t applicable in this case. Further, Iâ€™d have a lot more sympathy for McConnellâ€™s position if he was leading a charge for further action.

However, as it stands, we know that itâ€™s improbable that McConnel or anyone voting with him will pursue further action. Therefore, weâ€™re left with 43 Senators putting fealty to Trump â€” not even their party, but Trump himself â€” above the country.

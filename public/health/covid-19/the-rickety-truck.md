description: A metaphor to describe the current state of what might happen this spring and summer in Germany.
---

[German Virologist Christian Drosten is quite apprehensive][link] about what might happen this spring and summer. The metaphor he uses is that weâ€™re in a rickety truck driving down a steep mountain:

> ... and we donâ€™t know what curves are coming up and whether the road is suddenly about to get steeper. We also donâ€™t know how far we still have to go, but we do know that we absolutely have to avoid missing a corner. In a situation like this, closing our eyes doesnâ€™t help. We have to keep going and do one thing in particular: Hit the brakes, even if they might be rusty.

Of course, the brakes we need to hit are to get the reproduction of the virus down. The R number in Germany is currently at 0.9. Drosten proposes to intensify our shutdown to reduce the number to 0.7 and give ourselves a chance of a better spring.

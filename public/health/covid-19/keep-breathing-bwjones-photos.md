My dear friend and photographer Bryan Jones joined Stephan Dark to document [the 7AM shift change at the Univeristy of Utah Hospitalâ€™s Medical Intensive Care Unit][link] in Salt Lake City.

> Everyone is tired. Everyone is on the edge of burning out. Everyone is scared, and many are lonely as a result of protocols to keep their loved ones safe. Iâ€™ve worked in and around intensive care units for many years, and this was the first time that Iâ€™ve had medical care personnel break down in tears in routine conversation from the unrelenting stress of caring for others while trying to stay safe and keep their own families safe.

Beautiful, thoughtful photos of heros. And certainly not an easy assignment to take for Bryan.

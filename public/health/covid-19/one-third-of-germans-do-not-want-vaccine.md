From the _you have to be kidding me department:_ [34 percent of Germans said they do not want to be vaccinated at all.][link]

> The Norstat Institute interviewed more than 1,000 adults at the end of 2020 for the poll. According to the GÃ¼tersloh-based Bertelsmann Foundation, the rejection of vaccination and restrictions on freedom is above average among people who are particularly performance and success-oriented.

Apparently, thereâ€™s also a strong bias to the brand of vaccine:

> A recent survey by Spiegel on the topic found a significantly higher willingness of people in Germany to be vaccinated: 74 percent. However, the poll also showed that many people attach importance to a vaccine of their choice. The vaccine from BioNTech/Pfizer received the highest approval rating.

Given that every vaccine out there is highly effective in preventing symptomatic and severe COVID-19, I can only shake my head. Iâ€™ll be happy to take whatever is on tap when my turn comes to get the jab.

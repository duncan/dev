It hasnâ€™t been long at all since the COVID restrictions in Germany were somewhat relaxed. Already, however, the third wave seems to be building as [Deutsche Welle reports the incidence rate rising sharply][link]:

> Germanyâ€™s seven-day incidence rate for coronavirus infections on Saturday continued its rise of the past few days, reaching 76.1 cases per 100,000 residents. That represents a sharp increase over Friday, where the rate was 72.4, itself a marked jump from the day before.

Last week, the rate was 65.6. The next round of restrictions is supposed to automatically kick in when it goes over 100. However, some of the German states have already indicated that they might not actually follow through with restrictions. Dammit.

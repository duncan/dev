title: Hello Shopify
description: Today, Iâ€™m absolutely thrilled to start a new job at Shopify as Technical Advisor to the CEO.

When I decided to leave my previous job last year, I did a lot of self-reflection about how I want to work, what I want to work on, and who I want to work for. Once I had a good list, I searched for a matching role, both inside and outside Microsoft. It took a bit of time, and I had to leave Microsoft to get it, but I couldnâ€™t have designed a better role for myself if I tried than what Iâ€™m stepping into.

Today, Iâ€™m thrilled to be starting a new job at [Shopify][shop] as Technical Advisor to the CEO. Like really, absolutely, delighted.

The role fits how I want to work and what I want to work on. As far as who Iâ€™ll be working for, I first met Tobi in the Ruby on Rails community a long time ago. Itâ€™s been a true joy to see his path develop through the years, and Iâ€™ve really admired over time how heâ€™s consistently played the infinite game. [^1]

If thereâ€™s anything the world needs right now, itâ€™s more people playing the infinite game.

Itâ€™s not just Tobi who Iâ€™m thrilled to be working with. The people I interviewed with â€” [Delany Manders][dm], [Colin Bendell][cb], [Jeff Bruton][jb], [Simon Eskildsen][se], [Jean-Michel Lemieux][jml], and [Nicole Montini][nm] â€”Â  have filled me with inspiration for what the future of working with them will be like.So, itâ€™s with a lot of optimism and excitement that I start at Shopify today, along with over seventy other people starting this week.

Oh, and to pre-empt the inevitable question: My family and I will remain in Europe thanks to Shopify being [digital by default][dbd] and in support of its increasingly global presence.

[^1]: Two books on the subject of the infinite game are [Finite and Infinite Games by James P. Carse][fig] and [The Infinite Game by Simon Sinek][tig]. You might find the Sinekâ€™s book to be somewhat more approachable than Carseâ€™s.

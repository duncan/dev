Can you really replace JavaScript with Wasm and watch things get instantly faster? [Is WebAssmembly really magic pixie dust?][link] Surma write:

> V8 is really good at executing JavaScript. While WebAssembly can run faster than JavaScript, it is likely that you will have to hand-optimize your code to achieve that. I could see this balance shift once there is wide-spread support for SIMD and Threads and a good developer experience around utilizing them.

Iâ€™m keep being amazed at how far the JavaScript runtime has come. Iâ€™m not sure why Iâ€™m still suprised, but I am.

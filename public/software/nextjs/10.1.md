[Next.js 10.1][link] is now out, and the highlights are: three times faster refresh thanks to the integration of Facebook's Fast Refresh; fewer dependencies; and — good news for my day job — [integration with Shopify][commerce].

> After thousands of requests for Shopify, we've updated Next.js Commerce with a provider-agnostic UI — enabling you to bring any headless e-commerce solution of your choice.

The deeper I dig into the world of React server-side rendering and generation, the more impressed I get with how nicely these things work together. It's starting to get to a level of smoothness that, frankly, surprises me.

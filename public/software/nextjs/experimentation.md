title: Now building with Next.js

One of my New Year’s resolutions was to dig a bit deeper into [React][rjs]. It’s part of a personal project to rehabilitate my negative bias about the JavaScript ecosystem and to dig deeper into the parts that I find really interesting. In addition, I’ve been watching the [Next.js framework][nextjs] for a while. Now that it [supports static website generation][next-ssg], I decided it was time to dive in re-build my [duncan.dev][d] site using it, which you’re reading now.

About that bias of mine: I find most of the JavaScript ecosystem to be a layered hot mess. It has developed over time by a steadily accellerating accretion of ideas, and because of that, it can be really hard to see the gems. Next.js looks to be one of the gems. Paired with [TypeScript][ts], I’m finding that I’m enjoying it.

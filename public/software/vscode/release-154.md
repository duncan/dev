Native Apple Silicon support in Visual Studio code finally reaches the release ring in the [Feburary 2021 release (version 1.54)][link].

> Users on Macs with M1 chips can now use VS Code without emulation with Rosetta, and will notice better performance and longer battery life when running VS Code.

Huzzah! The Insiderâ€™s builds are almost always pretty stable. Still, itâ€™s nice to downshift to the more stable release train and not download new bits every other day or so.

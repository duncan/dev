I was really looking forward to [the January 2021 release of Visual Studio Code][link] (aka, version 1.53). I’ve been running on Insider’s builds of Code since I got my M1-based MacBook Pro and was hoping to be able to move back to the release train. Unfortunately, a last-minute bug squashed the team’s plans to release an Apple Silicon build.

> We originally planned to push the Apple Silicon builds to Stable this iteration. However, late in the iteration, users reported that on macOS Big Sur 11.2 loading a WASM module crashed the extension host.

Darn it. Don’t get me wrong. The Insider’s builds are almost always pretty stable, and I haven’t had an issue. But, I would like to stop downloading a new version every day or two.

title: Using Plausible analytics
---

Web analytics tools have long needed a reboot. We shouldn’t have to tie understanding how people are using our websites to surveillance capitalism. Even if you don’t mind feeding that particular beast, Google Analytics has become a beast to use.

[Plausible fills the need perfectly][link]. It bills itself as a lightweight and open-source tool that’s fully compliant with the GDPR, CCPA, and PECR regulations. You [can host it yourself][ghpa] from source as a container, or you can pay Plausible to do the heavy lifting.

This isn’t a paid placement, I’m just a happy subscriber.
